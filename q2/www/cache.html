		<p>Cache is a place on your hard disk that stores data from online so it doesn't need to be loaded
		over and over again. The reasons this exists is because it is quicker to pull something from your
		hard drive than to download it from the internet. The reason this would affect mail chimp is because
		once you register once the cache will remember that you did so the website will know that there is 
		no need to register again and it won't ask you.</p>
